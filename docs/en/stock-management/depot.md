# deposits

the deposits are used to store products, we can not talk about stock of products without talking about deposit. The concept of deposit allows to allocate the stock to different depots and to make movements between these deposits.

To access the deposit module:

<div class = "bs-callout bs-callout-success">
  <P> Depot > <strong>Depot Registry</strong>: This module is a registry that lists all the repositories in the system, and allows you to create new ones.
  </p>
</div>

To create a new repository, click on the **Add Depot** button which will open a modal window to enter repository information.
