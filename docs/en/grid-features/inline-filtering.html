      <h1 id="inline-filtering">Inline Filtering</h1>

<p>Some grids support <em>inline filtering</em>, the ability to filter the data on the client-side without having to re-query the server. The advantages of clientside filtering are:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Typically faster for small operations. No need to re-download and format the data for presentation.</li>
  <li>Data is filtered dynamically. Instead of hitting a submit button to enact the changes, changes are reflected as a user types.</li>
</ol>

<p>However, there are a few disadvantages to bear in mind:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Since no new data is downloaded, filters will only apply to dataset already downloaded. If the download was pre-filtered on the server, you may not have a complete dataset to begin with - always be sure that your local dataset has enough information to provide analysis.</li>
  <li>On low-power machines, this operation can slow the machine to its knees, particularly in heavier modules like the Journal or Account Statement.</li>
</ol>

<p>By default, inline filtering is off on all grids. To enable it, click on the <strong>filter button</strong>(&lt;i class=”fa fa-filter”&gt;&lt;/i&gt;) in the top of the module. When enabled, this button will turn a light blue color. The inline filter inputs will appear just underneath the column headers of the grid. Typing in any one of them will filter the grid contents.</p>

<div class="bs-callout bs-callout-warning">
<h4>Make sure you have a full dataset</h4>
Remember to always check that you have the full dataset before filtering, otherwise you may get misleading results.
